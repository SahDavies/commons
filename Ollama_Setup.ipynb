Where c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).\n4. To find c, we can rearrange the equation to get: c = √(a² + b²)\n5. Now, if we have the lengths of a and b, we can plug them into this formula to calculate the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nExample:\nSuppose we want to find the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle with legs of length 3cm and 4cm. \n\nWe use the Pythagorean theorem: c² = 3² + 4²\n= 9 + 16\n= 25\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find c:\nc = √25\n= 5cm\n\nSo, in this example, the length of the hypotenuse is 5cm."
