We need to know the lengths of the other two sides (the legs) of the triangle.\n2. The formula for the Pythagorean theorem is: c² = a² + b²\n3. Where 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse, and 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nFor example, if we have a right-angled triangle with one leg of length 3 inches and the other leg of length 4 inches, we can plug these values into the formula to get:\n\nc² = 3² + 4²\n= 9 + 16\n= 25\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = √25\n= 5 inches"
